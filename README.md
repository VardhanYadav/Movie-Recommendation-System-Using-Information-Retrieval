# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Information-Retrieval
This project implements a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering techniques. It utilizes a dataset of movies with features like genres, cast, director, and keywords to compute similarity scores between movies. The system leverages natural language processing techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies similar to a user's favorite. It is designed to provide efficient and accurate suggestions based on user preferences, enhancing user engagement through personalized movie discovery.
